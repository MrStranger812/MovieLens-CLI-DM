- **Normalization**: User rating bias correction, temporal trend adjustment

### 2. Advanced Regression Analysis with Gradient Descent Variants

Our regression module implements and compares three fundamental optimization approaches, specifically designed for large-scale recommendation data:

# Memory: ~8GB RAM required
# Convergence: Smooth, predictable
# Training Time: Slowest but most stable
```

#### **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)**
- **Implementation**: Updates model parameters after each individual rating
- **Characteristics**: Fastest initial convergence, most memory efficient

```python
# Processes one rating at a time
# Memory: ~100MB RAM required
# Convergence: Fast but noisy
# Training Time: Fastest, suitable for real-time systems
```

#### **Mini-Batch Gradient Descent**
